Code used for extracting ASA data. 

To get ASA data follow these steps:
1. Go to http://www.abren.net/asaview/
2. Graphical results are displayed with a link to download "relative ASA values (%)" as a text file.
3. Parse this text file in ASAParser python code as shown below: 

The relative ASA values are stored in variable SA[i] where i is the residue number (zero indexed). Residues with 5% or more ASA value could be classified as surface accessible.

Usage:

from ASAParser import *
asa = ASAParse("example_ASA_data.txt")
print asa.SA[10]
print asa.SA[12]
