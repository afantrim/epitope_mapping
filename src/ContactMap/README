Code used for extracting Contact map data from a PDB file. 

The distance in Angstroms between each residue pair is stored in dictionary self.Distances[i,j] where i and j are residue numbers (zero indexed).

Usage:

from PDBParser import *
pdb = PDBParse("example_PDB_data.pdb")
print pdb.Distances[10,15]
print pdb.Distances[12,23]
